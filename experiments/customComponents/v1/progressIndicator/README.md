# Progress Indicator

The Progress Indicator is a sample v1 custom component developed by Skuid, but not included in the product core. This article shows how to download the component from GitHub and install it in a new Component Pack in your org.

The Progress Indicator Component connects to a Tab Set or Wizard and shows users where they are in a process. Each step in the Progress Indicator connects to a single tab in a Tab Set or a step in a Wizard. You can also go through the JavaScript and CSS files for this component and see how it's set up to help you in developing your own custom components.


## Installing this component pack

Component packs must be uploaded to Skuid as zip files. Either compress the files within this directory using your tool of choice or run `make pack` to generate a zip file.

From there, upload the component pack to your Skuid instance by following the documentation appropriate for your platform:

- [Skuid for Salesforce](https://docs.skuid.com/latest/v1/en/skuid/components/original/manage-component-packs.html)
- [Skuid Platform](https://docs.skuid.com/platform/v1/en/skuid/components/original/manage-component-packs.html)


## Using this component
