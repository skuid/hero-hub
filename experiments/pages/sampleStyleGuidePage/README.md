# Sample Style Guide Page

Use a component-filled Skuid page to preview components and re-usable patterns to build a style guide for your Skuid project As you're making changes to your Design System, you may need to see how well that change might sit with the rest of the design. So having a page that show all design patterns in your app can be useful. Also, you and other collaborators can adhere to this guide as they build more pages, ensuring a cohesive UI in the end.

This page is built as a style guide for a sales application so you may see components or re-usable patterns that are relevant to this type of UI. However, for your project, you may have a different sets of patterns and components that work together to make up your Style Guide.

## Usage
Note: This example uses standard Salesforce objects for dummy data, so it should work in any Salesforce org.

1. Import the `salesAppStyleGuide.designsystem` design system into your Salesforce org.
2. Create a new Skuid page and paste/upload the xml file.
3. Edit away.

The design system included is not specific to Salesforce environment, so you can reuse the design system on a Skuid Platform site as well. You'd just need to build your own Style Guide page with your data instead of using the included xml.
