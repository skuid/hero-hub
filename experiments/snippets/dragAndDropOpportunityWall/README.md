# Opportunity Planning Wall

This page creates a kanban-inspired view of opportunities. They are broken down into columns for each stage.  A snippet enables drag and drop interactions, so an opportunity can be dragged from one column into another - which updates the stage name value.

## Stage Names

This example uses the following stage names.  
- Prospecting
- Negotiation/Review
- Proposal/Price Quote
- Closed Won
- Closed Lost

If you have defined different stage names in your org,  you will need to update the conditions on the opportunity models. 

## Notes

This functionality will only work in V1 Page API pages. The JQuery techniques leveraged in these snippets are not available in the V2 Page API.
