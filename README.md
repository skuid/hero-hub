# Skuid Labs

Skuid Labs is an open source repository where Skuid employees, community champions, and curious developers can toy with and contribute exciting, cutting-edge, and potentially-on-fire experiments. We want to see what makes working with Skuid better and faster for you.

Currently everything is nested under the `experiments` directory, where you’ll find the following:

- **Custom components**: New drag-and-drop components designed for bespoke needs that Skuid’s out-of-the-box components may not meet.
- **Custom field renderers**: These are used within some components to render fields in unique ways.
- **Formulas**: Custom formulas for use within UI-only fields.
- **Snippets**: General Javascript code fragments for use as payload handling snippets, Action Framework additions, etc.
- And more to come!

We want this to be a repository for unique pieces of content that push the limits of Skuid. Because of that adventurous goal, a banner saying **_Beware ye who enter_** hangs above the door. 

_There are no warranties, no support, and no guard rails for any of the projects within this repo. **Use at your own risk**_.

You’ve officially entered expert mode. Go forth and create!
