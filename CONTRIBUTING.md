# Contributing

## Why contribute?

We created Skuid Labs to provide a central place for Skuid builders to share extensions that they've created which could benefit other builders. If you've got a Skuid extension you've created that you want to share with the world, but weren't sure where to go, this is the place.

Your contributions also help shape the future of the Skuid product. When we see the kinds of components, formulas, and other extensions that Skuid builders are creating, that helps give us ideas about where to focus our efforts.

## How do I contribute?

If you've got something you'd like to submit, go ahead, clone this repository and submit a pull request! We just ask that you do the following:

- Ensure that your file names are **[camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)**.
- Create a folder for your experiment in the proper directory.
- Leave enough code comments to explain your experiment (or leave a description in a README file written in Markdown).

   - If applicable, note the [API version](https://docs.skuid.com/latest/en/skuid/api-version/) the [managed package release version](https://skuid.com/releases/) in which your experiment is intended to be used.

- We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure that your code matches our styles. If your code editor has an ESLint plugin installed, your code should automatically be linted, but you can alternatively just run `npm run lint` locally.

  The easiest way to do this is to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend using `nvm` to install the version of Node associated with this repository (`brew install nvm`) and run the following commands:

  ```bash 
  cd /path/to/skuid-labs
  # Install the associated version of Node
  nvm install
  nvm use
  # Install dev dependencies (ESLint, etc.)
  npm ci
  ```

  - If youâ€™ll be using variables that are not defined in the file, you may [set your globals in a comment at the top of your file](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-globals), but only use this when appropriate.
  - If you have a 3rd-party library that you are using in a component pack, we prefer that you reference that library via an external reference in your component pack manifest files, rather than including the library's minified JS locally in your component pack, unless the library is fairly small.
  - We recommend using ES5 for maximum compatibility among browsers.
