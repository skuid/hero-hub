# Contributing

## Why contribute?

We created Skuid Labs to provide a central place for Skuid builders to share extensions that they've created which could benefit other builders. If you've got a Skuid extension you've created that you want to share with the world, but weren't sure where to go, this is the place.

Your contributions also help shape the future of the Skuid product. When we see the kinds of components, formulas, and other extensions that Skuid builders are creating, that helps give us ideas about where to focus our efforts.

## How do I contribute?

If you've got something you'd like to submit, go ahead, clone this repository and submit a pull request! We just ask that you do the following:

- Ensure that your file names are **[camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)**.
- Create a folder for your experiment in the proper directory.
- Leave enough code comments to explain your experiment (or leave a description in a README file written in Markdown).

   - If applicable, note the [API version](https://docs.skuid.com/latest/en/skuid/api-version/) the [managed package release version](https://skuid.com/releases/) in which your experiment is intended to be used.
   - Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure that your code matches our styles.

  The easiest way to do this is to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the following commands:

  ```bash 
  cd /path/to/skuid-labs 
  npm install 
  ```

  This will install ESLint and its dependencies into a local `node_modules` directory. You can then run the linter by using `npm run lint`.

  - If youâ€™ll be using variables that are not defined in the file, you may [set your globals in a comment at the top of your file](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-globals), but only use this when appropriate.
  - We recommend ES5 for maximum compatibility among browsers.
