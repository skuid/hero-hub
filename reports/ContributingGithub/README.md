# Contributing to Github only using Github
This document is a step by step tutorial to contribution to Skuid Labs (or other status site generator) using just Github. 

One of the challenges many find to contributing to Github is the infrastructure typically required to do local development and then push changes to the remote repository.  The local copy is a convenience,  and is required if you need to ensure some piece of code works before committing it to the repository.  But in the case of content,  it is not required.  One may work entirely in the remote repository making changes and the daunting infrastructure of a code editor,  terminal commands,  git clients etc can be avoided.  This document shows how one does this work. 

## Instructions

**Step 1.  Go to the SkuidLabs Repo.**

**Step 5. Start typing name of new directory and Readme file.**

**Step 7. Commit your changes early and often.**
- Navigate to the bottom of your document 
- Write a commit message
